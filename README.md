## üí° What does this application do?

This is a simple and straightforward console application that allows you to convert currencies quickly and easily.
You just need to enter the three-letter codes for the currencies (for example, USD, EUR, COP) and the amount you want to convert.
You'll get the result instantly! Plus, it includes a quick guide to help you find the currency codes.

Now you can also check a history of conversions made, including the exact date and time they occurred.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Status

Currently, this project is **in active development**. New features are being implemented and the user experience is being improved.
Stay tuned for updates!

## ‚ú® Have a go! (Demonstration)

Although this is a console application, here's how it works:

1.  When you run the application, you'll see a menu with the following options:
    ```
    --- Currency Converter ---
    1. Currency Code Guide
    2. Start Conversion
    3. View Conversion History
    4. Exit
    ```

2.  **To see the currency code guide:** Select option `1`. A list of common codes will be displayed to help you.

    ```
    --- Currency Code Guide ---
    To perform the conversion, you will need to enter the three-letter codes that represent each currency. Here are some common examples:

    Colombia: COP
    United States: USD
    Europe: EUR
    United Kingdom: GBP
    Japan: JPY
    Canada: CAD
    Australia: AUD
    Switzerland: CHF

    You can search for the code of any other currency online if you don't find it in this list.
    --- End of Guide ---
    ```

3.  **To start a conversion:** Select option `2`. The application will ask you for:
    ```
    Enter the base currency (e.g., USD):
    ```
    Enter the code of the currency you want to convert from. Then, it will ask you for:
    ```
    Enter the currency to convert to (e.g., EUR):
    ```
    Enter the code of the currency you want to convert to. Finally, it will ask:
    ```
    Enter the amount of [Base Currency] to convert:
    ```
    Enter the number you want to convert. The application will show you the result.

    ```
    --- Conversion Result ---
    Base Currency: USD
    1 USD is equivalent to 0.88 EUR
    Enter the amount of USD to convert: 10
    10 USD is 8.80 EUR
    ```

    This conversion will be automatically saved in the history, including the date and time.

4.  **To view the conversion history:** Select option `3`. You will see a list with all the conversions made, including the rate used, the amount converted, and the date/time they were made.

    ```
    --- Conversion History ---
    [2025-05-03T14:25:17.123] 10.0 USD ‚Üí 8.80 EUR (Rate: 0.88)
    ```

5.  **To exit:** Select option `4`.

After each conversion or query, the application will show you the menu again so you can continue using the program.
